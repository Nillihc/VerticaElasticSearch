# Vertica and ElasticSearch, together

This is an exploratory intern project to extend Vertica with
ElasticSearch's text search features. The basic idea is to write a
[Vertica User Defined Extension](http://bit.ly/2fByQQH) in java that
queries ElasticSearch when you write certain SQL queries.

See [the plan](doc/plan.md).
